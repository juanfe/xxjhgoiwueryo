Deployment of Liquidity Spot [1]

1. I cloned the test app  from git clone git@vichara:liquidity.git
2. created symlinks from ~/django-nonrel directory as follows
  
     $ cd LiqSpot-app
     change to /LiqSpot-app
    [ LiqSpot-app ] $ ln -s <Yourpath/to>/django-nonrel/django django
    [ LiqSpot-app ] $ ln -s <Yourpath/to>/django-nonrel/djangoappengine/ djangoappengine
    [ LiqSpot-app ] $ ln -s <Yourpath/to>/django-nonrel/dbindexer/ dbindexer
    [ LiqSpot-app ] $ ln -s ../../django-nonrel/djangotoolbox/ djangotoolbox
  
     mark   is the space " "
     check if the symlinks have appeared
     using
  
     [ LiqSpot-app ]$ ls -la

3. logged in my appengine account using http://appengine.google.com
    [I already have a google account ]
4. Created an app named djangotestapp - It is a very easy process
    explore yourself , or follow this tutorial on youtube

5. once an app id ( djangotestapp ) is created we need to modify few things in cloned LiqSpot-app
    files , namely app.yaml and settings.py
    a) In app.yaml change application: ctst to application: djangotestapp
    b) (Optional ) change SITE_ID = 29 to SITE_ID = 1
6. Now use
    $ ./manage.py createsuperuser
      and create your super user details
    $ ./manage.py syncdb
     and sync the datastore
    $ ./manage.py runserver --- to run the appengine server locally
     and run the server  locally and point your browser to http://localhost:8000/
     You would see It Works! Page
7. Use  $ ./manage.py deploy
   to upload the application on appengine
8. point your browser to http://djangotestapp.appspot.com
   You would see It Works! Page
